            I'm Pawe≈Ç Smolarski, I have spent the last 6 years in the fire
            service working as a profesional firefighter. I have always had a
            knack for technology and working with computers. In 2021, I began to
            take a serious interest in Web Development. I started reading about
            HTML and CSS and began creating my first websites. Day by day the
            creation of pages became more and more interesting so I started to
            learn JavaScritpt.{" "}

            Fascinated with how intricate programming can be I was quickly drawn
            to learn more. I started looking for additional learning materials,
            book, courses and documentation to learn more and more about this
            technology. In July in 2021 I started a nine-month course "FullStack
            Developer" in Kodilla. It has been a very busy time, I have been
            diligently completing all materials every day and creating my
            additional projects. I started working with React and application
            development became more and more exciting. Over time, I became
            interested in the backend site. I became familiar with NodeJS,
            Express, NestJS and MongoDB. These technologies allowed me to create
            fullstack applications which you can see on my{" "}
