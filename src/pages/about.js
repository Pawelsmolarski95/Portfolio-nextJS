            I'm Pawe≈Ç Smolarski, I have spent the last 6 years in the fire
            service working as a profesional firefighter. I have always had a
            knack for technology and working with computers. In 2021, I began to
            take a serious interest in Web Development.

            Fascinated with how intricate programming can be I was quickly drawn
            to learn more. I started looking for additional learning materials,
            book, courses and documentation to learn more and more about this
            technology. I realized that I loved it. Developing websites and
            working with code has become my passion.

            I am an ambitious and open-minded person who loves programming and
            developing applications and websites. I believe that the most
            important thing in software development is passion, it is thanks to
            it that projects are unique and have a much higher value.
